# Computer Systems Design Lab

- Each lab is designed in VHDL using the Altera Quartus II software and tested using the Altera DE2 circuit board.

- A report is also included for every lab.

This course has introduced us to: 
- FPLD technology, logic synthesis, and rapid prototyping of digital systems
- Programmable logic technology 
- Sequential design and hierarchy
- Synthesis of digital hardware using VHDL
- State machine design
- CPU design
- Video Graphics Adapter (VGA) video display generation
- PS/2 keyboard interface design 

### Requirements
Each of these labs must be executed in Quartus II 

** With the exceptions of the labs labelled "ModelSim", which must be executed in ModelSim
